## Problems with LDS Doctrine & History

### Joseph Smith

### Polygamy

### Book of Mormon

### Racism

Multiple church Prophets & Apostles claim that people with a dark skin were less valiant in the pre-mortal life and therefore deserve fewer rights and privileges.

Here are some examples:

> "[Because of Cain's] wickedness he became the father of an in­ferior race. A curse was placed upon him and that curse has been continued through his lineage and must do so while time endures. Millions of souls have come into this world cursed with a black skin and have been denied the privilege of Priesthood... they have been made to feel their inferiority and have been separated from the rest of mankind from the beginning."

President Joseph Fielding Smith The Way to Perfection, p. 101

> "...those who were less valiant in pre-existence and who there­by had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the Negroes."

Apostle Bruce McConkie Mormon Doctrine (1958), p. 476

> “Had I anything to do with the negro, I would confine them by strict law to their own species...”

Joseph Smith, Jr., January 2, 1845, History of the Church, v. 5, pp. 21-218

> Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.

Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, 10:110

> “You may inquire of the intelligent of the world whether they can tell why the aborigines of this country are dark, loathsome, ignorant, and sunken into the depths of degradation…When the Lord has a people, he makes covenants with them and gives unto them promises: then, if they transgress his law, change his ordinances, and break the covenants he has made with them, he will put a mark upon them, as in the case of the Lamanites and other portions of the house of Israel; but by-and-by they will become a white and delightsome people.”

Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, Volume 7, page 336

> I think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation? It reminds me of the scripture on marriage, 'what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.' Only here we have the reverse of the thing ‑ what God hath separated, let not man bring together again.

Mark E. Petersen (LDS Apostle), Race Problems ‑ As They Affect The Church, Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954

Statement of the First Presidency August 17, 1951

> "The attitude of the Church with reference to negroes remains as it has always stood. It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. [ quotations from Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff, and discussion of the premortal existence...]..."
