## Problems with LDS Doctrine & History

### Joseph Smith

### Polygamy

### Book of Mormon

### Racism

Multiple church Prophets & Apostles claim that people with a dark skin were less valiant in the pre-mortal life and therefore deserve fewer rights and privileges.

* President Joseph Fielding Smith The Way to Perfection, p. 101

> "[Because of Cain's] wickedness he became the father of an in­ferior race. A curse was placed upon him and that curse has been continued through his lineage and must do so while time endures. Millions of souls have come into this world cursed with a black skin and have been denied the privilege of Priesthood... they have been made to feel their inferiority and have been separated from the rest of mankind from the beginning."

* Apostle Bruce McConkie Mormon Doctrine (1958), p. 476

> "...those who were less valiant in pre-existence and who there­by had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the Negroes."

* Joseph Smith, Jr., January 2, 1845, History of the Church, v. 5, pp. 21-218

> “Had I anything to do with the negro, I would confine them by strict law to their own species...”

* Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, 10:110

> Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.
